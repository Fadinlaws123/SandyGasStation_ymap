# How to Install

1. *Download the zipped file where the resources are located.*
2. *Navigate to your \resources diectory (Or wherever you are wanting to put it)*
3. *Drag and drop the folder into the directory you chose.*
4. *Add these lines into your server.cfg:*
```
# Gas Station yMaps
ensure GasPumpBarriers
```
5. *Restart your server and you're good to go!*

# What does this do?
* *What this basically does is add barriers to both Sandy Gas Station, cross of Marina Drive and Alhambra Drive and also adds them to the gas station on Panorama Drive. I found this to be a nice thing to have as it limits people's ability to just... ram a gas station and explode, especially when it's during a police chase.*


* ***I know that this ymap is pretty much anywhere online, but I was never able to find them, so I just decided to make one myself. Yes it's not very creative, but I decided to make it so people didn't have to waste so much time searching and searching for something so simple.***
